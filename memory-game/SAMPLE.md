# Sample Data Structures

Below are samples of the various data blocks used in the game render.

```python
# What the Icon Layout looks like - behind the scenes 4 x 4 Board
Sample_board_data = [
    ["ğŸ’§", "ğŸ§±", "ğŸš€", "ğŸ”µ"],
    ["ğŸ’§", "ğŸŸ¨", "ğŸŸ¨", "ğŸ”µ"],
    ["ğŸ’›", "ğŸ™‚", "ğŸ™‚", "ğŸ“Œ"],
    ["ğŸ“Œ", "ğŸ§±", "ğŸš€", "ğŸ’›"],
]
```

```python
# What the Click Reveal State Layout looks like - behind the scenes
sample_board_states = [
    [False, False, False, True],
    [False, True, True, True],
    [False, True, True, False],
    [False, False, False, False],
]
```

```python
# What the Block Layout and Location looks like - behind the scenes - a Block is (x, y, w, h)
sample_board_boxes = [
    [(220, 140, 40, 40), (270, 140, 40, 40), (320, 140, 40, 40), (370, 140, 40, 40)],
    [(220, 190, 40, 40), (270, 190, 40, 40), (320, 190, 40, 40), (370, 190, 40, 40)],
